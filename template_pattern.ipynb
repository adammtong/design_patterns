    "**Template Pattern**\n",
    "\n",
    "The template pattern is a design pattern which uses a base class as a template for implementation of related but different subclasses. The base class - which is usually an abstract class - defines the overall structure of the process while the sub classes refine and implement the details of certain steps in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The base class usually consists of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **template method** - this defines the structure or skeleton of the overall algorithm. It will generally call other methods and should not be overridden by the sub classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **abstract methods** - these methods define the customizable part of the algorithm which act as placeholders and **must** be overridden by the sub classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **methods common to each sub class** - these methods are implemented in the base class and can be overriden by the sub classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **(final) methods common to each sub class** - these methods are implemented in the base class and should **not** be overridden by the sub classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a simple demonstration of some of these features - there is a **worker** super class defined which has a **daily_routine** method which contains the details of a worker's daily routine. The overall routine is the same for each different type of worker (e.g. banker, firefighter) but the details are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will utilise the ABC (Abstract Base Classes) module to implement the infrastructure of an abstract class, as these are not native to python."
